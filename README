# DDI-GPMDB-Reader

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.


# INSTALLATION

This module does not need to be installed system wide, the only requesite
is to install the dependency modules found in the requirements file.
You can install the modules by using a local::lib or the system lib
folder.


# DEPENDENCIES

## Perl Modules

The programs depends on a few modules that can be easily installed using cpan.
Also, the program depends on a local MongoDB server running.

## MongoDB

A Mongodb server is necessary as the models will be stored at a local database
and collection.


# HOW TO USE

Before running the program, check if you have all the dependencies listed above, including
the mongodb server running.

Open the `run.pl` script and set the parameters for the program to run, including folder
and file locations. Also you need to set the name of the mongodb and collection.

Start the pipeline by executing the `run.pl` script. The program will start checking
your current list of models. Having all models listed, the program checks the ftp server
for the current file listing, any new file that is not listed on the `ignore` file will be
downloded, checked and stored in gz format.

After all files are downlaoded the program will transform each model on a mongodb record,
(only a selected number of fields are processed), and finally all records are grouped
and uploaded to the database.
